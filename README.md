# MedAxis Core
================

The central repository for MedAxis, housing the core algorithms, models, and data pipelines for advanced genomics, proteomics, and epigenomics research.

## Overview
--------

MedAxis Core is an open-source repository that provides a comprehensive suite of algorithms, models, and data pipelines for advanced genomics, proteomics, and epigenomics research. The repository is designed to facilitate the development of novel analytical tools and methods for the analysis of large-scale biological data.

## Features
--------

* **Genomics Pipelines**: A comprehensive suite of pipelines for genomics data analysis, including data preprocessing, alignment, variant calling, and downstream analysis.
* **Proteomics Pipelines**: A comprehensive suite of pipelines for proteomics data analysis, including data preprocessing, peptide identification, and protein quantification.
* **Epigenomics Pipelines**: A comprehensive suite of pipelines for epigenomics data analysis, including data preprocessing, peak calling, and downstream analysis.
* **Machine Learning Models**: A collection of machine learning models for the analysis of genomics, proteomics, and epigenomics data, including models for classification, regression, and clustering.
* **Data Visualization Tools**: A suite of data visualization tools for the visualization of genomics, proteomics, and epigenomics data, including tools for heatmap generation, scatter plot generation, and genome browser visualization.
